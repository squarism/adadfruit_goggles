## Adafruit Goggles

Fun with the ever-fun, ever-awesome adafruit googles "kit".  You have to buy all the parts.  Most of these sketches assume pin 4.  Please read the assembly instructions on [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com).  Especially important is the capacitor and resistors to make sure you don't burn out the LED strip.

Credit goes to Adafruit for the example code from which most of these are modified.
